# Quiz_Resolver
"Quiz" is an application that helps people take tests. It not only reads questions and answers from the database but also tracks the time users spend completing the test. After finishing the test, the application displays the correct answers and the total number of questions. This helps users assess their knowledge and see which questions they answered correctly.


- ! Before launching the application, configure the path to your database in the app.config file. Ensure it is either your own database or the provided one.
